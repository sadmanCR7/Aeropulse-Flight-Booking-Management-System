## ‚ú® Key Features & Modules

AeroPulse is built around three core user roles, each with a tailored set of features.

### üë§ For Passengers (The User Benefit Interface)

*   **Elegant Multi-Step Onboarding:** A guided, 4-step registration wizard for a smooth signup experience, collecting personal, contact, and profile information, including a photo upload.
*   **Advanced Flight Search:** An intuitive interface to find flights based on route, number of passengers (Adults, Children, Infants), and travel class (Economy/Business), featuring searchable airport dropdowns.
*   **Personalized Dashboard:** A central hub for registered users to view their complete booking history, check flight statuses (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled), and access key actions.
*   **Complete Booking Lifecycle:** A seamless end-to-end booking flow, from a detailed fare confirmation page to a simulated payment gateway, with automated generation of printable **e-tickets** and **invoices**.
*   **Full Profile Management:** Users can view and update all their personal details‚Äîincluding their name, contact info, address, gender, and profile photo‚Äîfrom a dedicated profile page.
*   **Easy Cancellations & Reviews:** Passengers can cancel confirmed bookings and leave post-flight reviews (rating and comment), contributing to a community-driven experience.
*   **Live Notifications:** A real-time notification system in the navbar keeps users informed of important updates.

### üåü The Unique Features Showcase

What truly sets AeroPulse apart is its focus on travel discovery.

#### The Global Price Map
Turn flight booking into an adventure. This interactive world map allows users to select a departure airport and instantly see a "heatmap" of global travel affordability, with countries color-coded by the cheapest available flight price. It‚Äôs a powerful data visualization tool that answers the question: "Where in the world can I afford to go?"

*   **Full CRUD Functionality:** Administrators have complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete control over all core data, including **Flights** (with separate pricing/seating for Economy and Business), **Airlines**, and **Airports**.
*   **System Oversight:** Admins can view all user bookings, manage passenger accounts, moderate reviews, and send notifications.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (ER Diagram)

The database was designed from a conceptual E-R Diagram to a relational schema, ensuring adherence to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**. This robust design guarantees data integrity, eliminates redundancy, and provides a scalable foundation for the application.

A single, deliberate exception to 3NF is the `total_fare` field in the `Booking` table. This is a standard denormalization practice to "snapshot" the price at the time of transaction and significantly improve query performance.
